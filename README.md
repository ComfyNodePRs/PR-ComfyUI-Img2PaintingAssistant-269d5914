# ComfyUI-Img2PaintingAssitant
These are ComfyUI nodes to assist in converting an image to paintings and to assist the Inspyrenet Rembg node to totally remove or replace with a color the original background from images so that the background does not reappear in videos or in nodes that do not provide handling for the alpha channel in images.
